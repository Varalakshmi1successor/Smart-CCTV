# Smart-CCTV

Preview of our Implementation :https://youtu.be/UBkna8Lx_F0?si=p7N6pJwNAwU2WMft

**Idea/Solution/Prototype :**

**Crowd Management:** Yolo Algorithm is used for real-time crowd density monitoring, with high-density alerts sent to security via Twilio MMS.

**Crime Detection**: Anomalies in CCTV frames are detected using a hybrid LSTM-CNN model, triggering immediate security phone call alerts.

**Work Monitoring:** The web dashboard built with Dash and SHAP shows live CCTV feeds and visualizes crowd density and crime data.
The system provides real-time alerts for crimes, high crowd density, and uses AI to monitor and maintain station cleanliness.


**Technology stack:**

**YOLO** -Crowd** density Calculations across the Temporal frames of videos footages.
**Hybrid LSTM-CNN –Detects Crime
**Twilio**- Create alerts(Automated calls,MMS)
**Dash**-Creates Web-Dashboard for monitoring
**SHAP**-AIML model integration with dashboard.

**Usecases:**
Enhancing Railway Security: Integrating Criminal Database with Live CCTV for Proactive Alerts.

Smart Cleaning: Use predictive analytics to schedule cleaning during busy periods, ensuring cleanliness in stations.

Privacy Protection:Anonymizing CCTV footage data safeguards privacy while enhancing crowd management and crime prevention. 
 
Data Visualization:Graphs, created from crowd and crime model simplify data analysis for security  personnel and administrators.

Our AI integration in Indian Railways' surveillance may cut operational costs by 10%, maintenance costs by 30%, and save on energy

**Show Stopper**

Large Data Sets: Special computing techniques and cloud technology are used to handle and process large amounts of data effectively.
